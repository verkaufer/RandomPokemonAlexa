      Welcome to the Random Pokemon Generator.
      If you need assistance, say "help." What can I generate for you? 
  </speak>

help_main: |
  The Pokemon Generator can generate up to 6 Pokemon of any type and from any region or Pokedex. For example,
  say "generate a team" to get Pokemon of any type from any region. Or say "get 3 fire type Pokemon from Kanto" to
  return only fire Pokemon from the Kanto Pokedex.

genator_problem: Sorry, the Generator is having some problems right now. Please try again.

oneshot_pokemon: |
   Your Pokemon {{ '%s' % 'are' if pokemon|length > 1 else 'is' }}: {{ pokemon|join(', ') }}

list_of_regions: |
  I can generate Pokemon from any of the following regions: {{ regions|join(', ') }}. What can I generate for you? 

generate_reprompt: What can I generate for you?

number_of_pokemon_error: The Generator can generate 1 to 6 Pokemon at a time. Please try again.

region_error: That region is not recognized by the Generator. Say "list regions" to hear the supported Pokedex regions.

custom_generated_pokemon: |
    Your {{ num_pokemon }} {{ pokemon_type|capitalize }} Pokemon from the {{ region|capitalize }} region {{ '%s' % 'are' if pokemon|length > 1 else 'is' }}:
    {{ pokemon|join(', ') }}.
